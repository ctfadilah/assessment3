Project Title: to perform image classification to classify concretes with or without cracks

Project Description:
- Developed model is impactful and may save thousands of lives. 
- Link to the dataset:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2
- Carry out the whole machine learning workflow for this project (Problem
Formulation →Data Preparation→Model Development→Model
Deployment).
- For criteria, try to achieve training and validation accuracy of more than 90%
- To make sure model is not overfitting.
- Apply transfer learning

What your project does?
- import packages
- Data loading
- Split data
- Data inspection
- Splitting the val_dataset into validation and test datasets
- Convert the data set into prefetch dataset
- Create a keras model for data augmentation
- Test out the data augmentation model
- Create a layer to perform the pixel standardization
- Start to apply transfer learning
- Compile the model
- Evaluate the model before training
- Create a TensorBoard callback object for the usage of TB
- Model training
- Proceed with the follow-up training
- Recompile the model
- Continue with the model training
- Evaluate the final transfer learning model
- Model deployment
- Save the model

Any challenges you face and how you solve them? 
- Yes, the challenges that i face is big dataset to download and a bit confius to understand the question. But after read carefully, i can do it better.
